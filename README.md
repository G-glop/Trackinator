# Todo

- [X] Put Obsidian notes inside the repo
- [X] Add a README.md
- [x] Search the calendar for any Trackinator info and add it here
	- [x] select the flex connector & crystals & oscillators (to free up browser tabs)
	- [x] transfer my eyetrack diagram to kicad (don't worry about simple component values/choices)
	- [x] abandon fully flex design and opt into frunkable + flex illuminators / extensions
	- [ ] drive all ir leds from a single current limited source to ensure sum i <= safe limit
- [ ] M.2 like half screw-hole for mounting in a custom frunk housing
- [x] Import new FFC connector
- FCC connector orientaion:
	- Face cams prefer pins up
	- Eye and nose cams prefer pins down
- [ ] Place the hub indicator LEDs close to their respective ESP/downstream port
- [ ] ESP UART output headers
- [x] Remove `fp-info-cache` from the repo and ignore it
- [x] Add camera pinout to it
	- Did the option with least fewest crossing lines, could've copied the xiao but eh
- [ ] Symmetrize all the connectors and lock them
- [x] Select and add USB C and A female connectors
  - [ ] What does a USB C host port need in addition to P+N+5V+GND?
- [x] 3D print the outline + USB A + FFC connectors to check the fit
- [ ] Switch KiCad to JLCPCB 4+ layer capabilites (I'm gonna need them)
- [ ] Use painters tape + scanner + 3d printer to prototype a flex PCB (or 3D scan / manally model the index)
  - [ ] IR illumination
  - [ ] Ambilight
  - [ ] Reuse the 24P FFC connector
	  - Either look at the [camera mechanical drawings](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003906449317.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.10.361c1802tWpc3p) or at the [FFC connector datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2001071406_XFCN-F0503-ZV-24-20T-R_C481246.pdf)
- [ ] Add headers as an alternative to the flex PCB + FFC connector
- [x] Add a few ERM drivers
	- [ ] If i run out of space, replace some of the RS485 drivers with N mosefts
- [x] Move tasks from the system diagram here
	- Flex PCB hatching instead of solid pours provide better flexibility but shouldn't be used with high frequency. Use denser hatching if possible
	- [ ] ESPs connected to a shared bus (I2C?) for sidechannel communication
	- [ ] Strapping pins so each ESP can tell where it is (or voltage divider on an ADC pin)
	- [x] Shared RESET and GPIO0 signals connected to buttons
	- [ ] Series JTAG for the hell of it
	- [x] PWM + Tacho PC fan header (commodity PC fans run at 12 V and usually require at least 7 V to start - do i need a boost converter?)
		- [ ] Add 5V/ground switching in addition to PWM to be safe
		- [ ] (maybe) add some option of a 12V boost converter
	- [ ] Make a few recordings to try out how much of an impact the dead cats make on audio - they're right in the space for mouth tracking cameras
- [ ] Add good quality voltage sources (switch mode where applicable)
	- [x] Bucks for 3v3 and WS2812B
	- [ ] LDOs for 1v2 and 2v8 camera supplies (low noise)
- [ ] Add a footprint for the google coral AI chip? (G313-06329-00)
	- Needs usb + power + space for all the ground pins
	- Or use the M.2 PCIe version(s) and stuff it into the PC
- [ ] Add thermal vias under the ESPs
- [ ] (meme) composite all 5 camera feeds together into a cursed webcam - "vision pro without ai"
- [x] Align the USB A male 3d model with footprint
	- [x] Same for the buck module
- [ ] Use the "Round Tracks" plugin from mixtela together with via/pad teardrops
	- It's an actual benefit on flex PCBs
- [ ] The flex PCBs of the cameras seem to have some intentional engineering compared to "bunch of parallel tracks" like a FFC cable.
- Add logos:
	- [ ] EyeTrackVR
	- [ ] OpenSourceHW
	- [ ] G_glop
- [ ] Add an automatically updating "Exported at \[date] \[tag] \[branch] \[commit #]" text
	- Date is easy using the ${CURRENT_DATE} variable
- LCSC Order:
	- [x] USB connector
	- [x] Fan headers
	- [ ] IR Leds
	- [ ] Trim pot to tune WS2812B supply voltage
- [ ] Export a 3D model of the board and make it into a VRChat world with the top & bottom (copper + mask + silkscreen) are the ceiling & floor, and vias are columns between the two (scale correct?)
	- The VRML export is fine (imports into Blender) but everything is geometry, use it only for vias and export everything else as SVG (later rasterzied)?
	- There're no gradients and sharp edges are greatly reduced by using teardrops, mSDF(s) could be a better choice than an RGB texture.
		- https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen (only accepts SVG - use Plot in KiCad)
		- (a) 2 mSDFs selecting between 3 colors
		- (b) 1 mSDF selecting between 2 textures
		- or (c) quantize the interpolated RGB value back to one of the 3 colors
	- Rave mode which shows the frequency and direction of signal on each trace.
		- SDFs could be useful for outlines
